# Store-System-Amazon-Dynamo
A distributed key-value store system. Nodes in this system communicate with network calls. The implementation has the following system properties: scalability, availability and resilience to temporary node failures. The manager is always running and takes care of data storage. Clients can come at any point of time and can make requests to add/remove items. The system will ensure that the most up-to-date data is returned to the client. The system is robust and ensures data partitioning, data replication and data consistency in case of node failures.
